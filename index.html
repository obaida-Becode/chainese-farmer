    <p >In nature, <tag attribute="good">good</tag> & Evil do not exist. The Universe itself is neither <tag attribute="good">good</tag> nor <tag attribute="bad">bad</tag>, but a potential in permanent
        development.</p>
    <p>
        <p> In life, there are 4 types of people. </p>
        <ol>
        <li> people who think the Internet is <tag attribute="good">good</tag>.</li>
        <li> people who think the Internet is evil.</li>
        <li> people who think the Internet is cats.</li>
        <li> people who don't thin about it.</il>
    </ol>

    <p> Up in space. turning around, looking at the earth’s face. <br> From that rock’s perspective on Mars or that gaz
        opinion from Jupiter, nothing cares about your problems. <br> Up there, it’s just not serious, and there’s no
        such
        thing as an issue. <br>

        Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain. <br> Nothing exists if the brain doesn’t think it. <br>
        Nothing
        exists neither if our senses don’t transmit the message. <br> That means that if we mis sense, our reality changes.
        <br>
        That’s possible because our perception is limited : you can’t see at 360 degrees for example. <br> If we mis
        translate the message, our reality changes. <br> If we think it in a way, our reality changes depending on that
        way. <br>
        Therefore, if we can change reality that much, everything’s fake.

        They’re proofs to that. Fall in love with someone and you’ll see that person as divine. <br> Pull yourself out
        of
        that grip and the divine falls from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself differently. <br> But the
        person
        is the same, you just changed your mind. <br> Everything works like that : it’s not just that you can make your
        world, it’s that you passively do it anyway.</p>

    <h3>The Story</h3>

        alt="The Old Chinese Farmer">
    <blockquote> Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around
        to commiserate. <br>  They said, <q> We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away . <br> This is most unfortunate.</q> The
            farmer said, <q> Is it <tag attribute="good">good</tag>? Is it <tag attribute="bad">bad</tag?> I don't know.</q> <br> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild
            horses
            with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of
            events. <br>
            You now have eight horses!” The farmer again said, <q> Is it <tag attribute="good">good</tag>? Is it <tag attribute="bad">bad</tag> I don't know. </q> <br>

            The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his
            leg. <br> The neighbors then said, <q> Oh dear, that’s too <tag attribute="bad">bad</tag>, </q> and the farmer responded, <q> Is it <tag attribute="good">good</tag>? Is it <tag attribute="bad">bad</tag> I
            don't know. </q> <br> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they
            rejected his son because he had a broken leg. <br> Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q> Isn’t that
            great!</q> <br>
            Again, he said, <q> Is it <tag attribute="good">good</tag>? Is it <tag attribute="bad">bad</tag>? I don't know.</q> <br>

            The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to
            tell <br>
            whether anything that happens in it is <tag attribute="good">good</tag> or <tag attribute="bad">bad</tag> — because you never know what will be the consequence of <br>
            the
            misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <tag attribute="good">good</tag> fortune. <br>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p><tag attribute="good">good</tag> and <tag attribute="bad">bad</tag> are just one perspective. Bananas are <tag attribute="good">good</tag> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <tag attribute="good">good</tag> for bananas.
        Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
